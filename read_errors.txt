This doc is about the errors I came across while developing the project

    =>git init ed and added .gitignore but it is not ignoring the files
        - I see all the files turning gren (meaning git is not ignoring)
        - Used rm -rf .git to to delete git repo

            FIX :: once the files turns gree it just means 
    
    =>Could not upload local repo to remote 
        -tried following steps
            -$git init
            -$git add .
            -$git status
            -$git commit -m 'xyz message'
            -$git remote add origin 'url_address'
            -$git remote -v
            -$git push -u origin master

                -later when nothing worked i reverted back using $rm -rf .git(to remove git from local)

            FIX :: ?

    =>res.send(number)
        -could not use res.send to send any number 
        FIXED:: I had to convert that vatiable to string using .toString (ref. questionOne.js)

    =>Error [ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT]: Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client
        -Gave an error if I try to do app.res('') TWICE
            FIXED :: you can't use app.res twice because you already responded to the client the first time you sent res.send

    => "RangeError [ERR_HTTP_INVALID_STATUS_CODE]: Invalid status code: 0"
        - variables finalScore & setTimer are declared in nameMatch.js and 
          need to access those variables in server.js but am not able to do so..why?
                FIXED ::
